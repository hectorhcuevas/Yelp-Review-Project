# Analysis of Gym Reviews on Yelp

This data science project utilizes the [Kaggle Yelp dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) and focuses on the analysis of reviews for gym/fitness facilities. There were 2,000+ businesses in the dataset which fell into this category, and a total of ~34,000 reviews to analyze. I first ran exploratory data analysis to find general trends and demographics among the businesses. I then turned my focus to reviews and used sentiment analysis, clustering, and topic modeling to uncover trends and key factors which made up a negative or positive review.
